The following documentation outlines the configuration for the connector and how to implement functions specifically for **Google Dialogflow Version 1**.

{: .important}
Google has deprecated Dialogflow **Version 1** and customers should move to Version 2 if they have not already planned to do so by October 2019

### Bot Configuration

{: .important}
See the [Getting Started](bot-connectors-getting-started.html) guide first.

Outlined below is a sample bot config object that is used to log the bot into **LiveEngage** as well as pass through any info required for each bot vendor.

The following information should be provided to LivePerson.

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>AccountID</td>
    <td>LiveEngage Account ID</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>Default transfer message</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


#### Naming Conventions

Few things to note before going into *actions* and *skills* is the naming convention between each. 

* For escalations, the naming convention for these skills should use a "-" instead of “_”. Furthermore, if transferring to a skill, specifically assigned to bots, it’s best practice to prefix the skill name with “BOT-” within LiveEngage.

* We use the character ‘.’ as a delimiter in the ‘action’ object. We recommend that you do **NOT** use  ‘.’ in a skill name in LiveEngage. Refer page 11, section: *Transfer/Escalations* for an example.

### Limitations

#### Dialogflow Query length Limit 

The Dialogflow service has a [limitation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/agent/query) on the length of the ‘query’ object. Any query longer than 255 characters invokes a standard response as below. To handle this gracefully, we recommend building a simple intent that handles a DIALOGFLOW_CHAR_LIMIT’ *event*. 

**Sample Syntax : Dialogflow Request Object**

```json
{
    "contexts":[] ,
    "lang": "en",
    "query": "user-query-goes -here",
    "sessionId": "12355",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"   
}
```

    }
}
```

1. Create an intent with an event using the string:  DIALOGFLOW_CHAR_LIMIT

2. Do not forget to add a custom response in the **Text response** section.

### Welcome Event

The behaviour of the welcome event is different depending on whether the bot is for chat or messaging. This divergence comes down to the way that each individual Liveperson product works and how it is framed with the consumer.

A Messaging interaction qualifies as "initiated" from a LiveEngage perspective only after the consumer sends their first message. The consumer is prompted for their initial message in the channel they have chosen to initiate the conversation. As a result, the consumer’s first message is something that can be parsed by Dialogflow and an intent determined . 

These docs cover where to configure the initial message on a given platform

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Platform</th>
    <th>Docs</th>
    <th>Attribute</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>iOS</td>
    <td>https://developers.liveperson.com/consumer-experience-ios-sdk-localizationkeys.html</td>
    <td>hiMessage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Android</td>
    <td>https://developers.liveperson.com/android-modifying-string.html#resultOverlayRecordTemplate</td>
    <td>lp_first_message</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


A Chat interaction on the other hand is considered started when the chat is routed to an agent, and best practice is for the agent to provide the first response. In this scenario, there is no text from the consumer to parse, thus the default ‘WELCOME’ event is utilised as a start point for the bot to prompt the user to provide input and progress the conversation.

As such, ensure you have an ‘entry point’ intent that utilises the default ‘WELCOME’ event, so the event fired is utilised.

### Change Time To Response of Conversation

Change the TTR of a conversation based on the **action** value in the response object. LP uses 4 different types of priorities: "URGENT", “NORMAL”, “PRIORITIZED”, “CUSTOM”. Only the “CUSTOM” can set a value. The unit of the value is second. And the value of the others are defined in the Agent Workspace.

### Transfer / Escalations

If the bot needs to transfer the conversation to a human agent, or the conversation flow indicates that another bot is better suited for the identified intent, you will need to tell the connector to transfer the conversation to a given skill.

This is achieved using the built in "Actions and Parameters" section of the Dialogflow console.

Multiple scenarios for transfer/escalations exist triggered by the action object or the absence of a response. 

1. Explicit request from visitor to transfer to an agent  (Eg, action : transfer.bot-escalation)

2. If the Bot does not have an appropriate answer, it will recognise this as a scenario for a transfer, depending on the connector configuration or the decision making capacity of the bot, the bot  will transfer to a particular skill or default skill  (if agents are available). (Eg, action: transfer.BOT-input-unknown)

3. If there is a internal error and the bot service cannot be reached the connector will transfer to a default skill .

Transfers and escalations rely on the *action* item in the response object.

1. Action:      `transfer.<skill-name>`
    (e.g. transfer.bot-escalation where ‘bot-escalation’ is the skill name)

2. Action:	     Input.unknown

The connecter uses the ‘.’ as a delimiter to separate the transfer action and skill to transfer to.

If my skill is named - **BOT-default-escalation**

Then my action will be - **transfer.BOT-default-escalation**

### Send Rich Content (Structured content)

Structured content/Rich Content is supported by the core LivePerson platform. Documentation for the feature can be found [here](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html). To send structured content via Dialogflow, use the Dialogflow option to send a *custom payload* via the intent, containing valid structured content, along with metadata required for the structured content (as seen in Figure 4.2). Always validate your structured content using [this tool](https://livepersoninc.github.io/json-pollock/editor/) before entering into the DialogFlow console.

            "text": "product category (type)",
            "tooltip": "product category (type)"

            "text": "$155.99",
            "tooltip": "$155.99"
         }
      ]
   }
}

### Close Chat/Conversation

In the bot’s flow, there will be times when it is appropriate to end the conversation with the consumer without escalating to a live agent. If a query has been answered, or the brand has determined that no escalation is available for a given query, then you will need to have the bot end the conversation.

The method for closing a conversation is similar to the transfer action in that the same "Actions and Parameters" field is utilised in the Dialogflow console.

The field needs to be set to **closeConversation** to instruct the connector to to close the conversation.

Below is an example of what the response JSON from Dialogflow will look like, and what the connector expects in order to complete a closeConversation action.
